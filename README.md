# LLM Memory System Transition

Welcome to the LLM Memory System Transition project. In this project, we prompted various LLMs to generate code that can be used in VANS that transfer the memory system to CXL memory.

## Setup

To use the code provided in `generation/`, please run the following in advance:

```
pip install openai
pip install --upgrade together
pip install anthropic

git clone https://github.com/TheNetAdmin/VANS.git
git clone https://github.com/SlugLab/CXLMemSim.git
```

## Prompts and Outputs

The prompts and outputs mentioned in our writeup are stored in `prompts/` and `outputs/`.

## Run Generation

To use the LLMs, please first go to `generation/generation_util.py` and replace the API keys with your OpenAI, TogetherAI, or Anthropic API keys. Then, please run

```
python3 generate.py --prompt [path_to_your_prompt_dict] --model [model_name] --output_path [path_for_the_output]
```

where `prompt_dict` should be a pickle file that stores a python dict, using some keys and values being the prompt the LLMs should read. The program will store the generated result of the LLMs at path_for_the_output as a pickle file stores a python dict, with the same set of keys, but the values are replaced by the output generated by LLMs. `model_name` should be one of `["gpt4", "llama7b", "llama13b", "llama70b", "stripedhyena", "mistral", "claude3", "opus"]`

Here is an example of generating using GPT4:

```
python3 generate.py --prompt ./prompts/code_generation_long.pickle --model gpt4 --output_path ./outputs/gpt4_generation_long.pickle
```
